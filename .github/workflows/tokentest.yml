# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Is there a token here?
      - name: Token Test
        run: |
          myFancyToken=${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          echo Token lenght is
          echo $myFancyToken | wc -c
          start="${myFancyToken::4}"
          end="${myFancyToken::(-8)}"
          echo "Min mønt er: $start ... $end"
          echo Tadaa!
